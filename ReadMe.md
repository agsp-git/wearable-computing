# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo was created to finish the assignment for week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project.

### Instruction
1. Download and unzip the data file into your R working directory.
2. Download the R source code into your R working directory.
3. Execute R source code to generate tidy data file.

### Dataset (Wearable Computing)
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Use command rbind to combine training and test set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Use grep command to get column indexes for variable name contains "mean()" or "std()"
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Convert activity labels to characters and add a new column as factor
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Give the selected descriptive names to variable columns
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Use pipeline command to create a new tidy dataset with command group_by and summarize_each in dplyr package

### Files
- <code>CodeBook.md</code> a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

- <code>Run_Analysis.R</code> performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- <code>Final_TidyData.txt</code> is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
